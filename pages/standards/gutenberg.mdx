# Gutenberg Code Standards
Gutenberg is based in React, Javascript, and PHP and should follow those but have a few differences or nuances that we should be aware of.

## PHP
The WordPress default coding standards are used for all PHP files in this plugin. More on that [here](/standards/php).

## React & Javascript
For React and JavaScript, we've adopted the `@wordpress/eslint-plugin` and its coding standards.
More on that [here](/standards/react).

## Gootsâ„¢/Block Editor
<Callout type="info">
  Standards can be updated with discussion based on industry standards.
</Callout>

Additionally we're following best practices for WordPress documentation and organization defined
by the [Gutenberg Repo](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg).

### Programmatic state updates & undo history
Sometimes, a block will programmatically change state, such as when a story
block's configuration changes and related attributes are updated as blocks load.
When this happens, it can prevent a user from undoing block insertion by
creating an infinite loop of state changes that are re-applied each time the
undo feature is triggered. Gutenberg provides a function that should be called
before such an update is made, which ensures that the undo functionality behaves
as expected.

The following is an abridged example:

```jsx
import { useDispatch } from '@wordpress/data';

const { __unstableMarkNextChangeAsNotPersistent } = useDispatch(
	'core/block-editor'
);

__unstableMarkNextChangeAsNotPersistent();
setAttributes( { example: true } );
```

Props to [talldan's PR](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/26377) for
highlighting how to address this situation.
