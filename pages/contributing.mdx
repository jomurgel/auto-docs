# Contributing to the Docs

Documentation can be added to `auto-docs` either either manually or automatically.

* __Manual documentation__ is added to `auto-docs` directly.
* __Automatic documentation__ is extracted/synced from an external source.

## Manual documentation

Manual updates would be documentation that is unrelated or independent from a GitHub repository.

- Issue a PR against the [auto-docs](https://github.com/jomurgel/auto-docs) repo.
- Make sure to take a look at the [Nextra Docs](https://nextra.site/docs/guide) for what is
supported automatically before adding new features.
- Make sure to update the [package.json](../package.json) version.

## Automated documentation

Some automation has been added to this repo as a workflow during build time. That automation does one
of the following:

- Copies a directory of markdown files.
- Parses directories and auto-generates markdown files based on README files and the contents of PHP
classes and javascript files.

### Supported automation

Several elements of PHP and JavaScript files are automatically parsed and documented, but not all.
Supported features include:

- **PHP Class files:** docBlocks, class docBlocks, class methods, WordPress method filters.
- **JS Functions:** docBlocks, methods, WordPress filters.

### Usage
TBD

Several functions exist to help find files/directories and copy or parse its contents:

#### `getNonHiddenFolders`

Get non hidden folders for a given directory.

- `source`: string — directory pathname.

#### `getNonHiddenFiles`

Get non hidden files for a given directory.

- `source`: string — directory pathname.

#### `getFilesAndFolders`

Gets non hidden files and folders for a given directory.

- `source`: string — directory pathname.

#### `getRelativePath`

Forms a relative pathname relative to the root auto-docs directory.

- `source`: string — directory pathname.

``` jsx
// Output example: ...[path to root]/wp-content/plugins/auto-docs/pages.
getRelativePath('/pages')
```

#### `processDirectory`

Process a single directory.

- `source`: string — directory source pathname.
- `output`: string — directory output pathname.

``` jsx
processDirectory(
 `${source}/${folder}`,
 getRelativePath(`/pages/core-tech/gutenberg/${folder}`)
);
```

#### `copyDirectoryContents`

Copy the entire source of a directory wholesale to a destination.

- `source`: string — directory source pathname.
- `output`: string — directory output pathname.
- `excludeDirectories`: array — array of directories to exclude.
- `excludeFiles`: array — array of files to exclude.

``` jsx
copyDirectoryContents(
 `/docs`,
 getRelativePath('/pages/sub/directory'),
 ['directory-name'],
 ['file-name.mdx']
);
```

#### `copyFileContents`

Copy a single file from one location to another.

- `source`: string — directory source pathname.
- `output`: string — directory output pathname.

``` jsx
copyFileContents(
 `/docs/file-name.mdx`,
 getRelativePath('/pages/sub/directory/file.mdx'),
);
```
